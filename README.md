# Coinbook

This is my own **pet project**. It is an app for home financial accounting. Currently available in English only.

The user of the app can keep track of the following data:

* Income
* Expenses
* Categories of expenses (required to add expenses)
* Limit for categories
* Accumulation of money (Money box)
* Debts
* Alarms for some events (not yet implemented)

**IMPORTANT**: It is currently still under development. I am still working on some bugs and coming up with some new interesting features.
